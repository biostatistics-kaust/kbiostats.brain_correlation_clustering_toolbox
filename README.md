# BCC: Brain Correlation Clustering

![BCC screenshot](./resources/src/img/BCC-screenshot.jpg)

BCC is an animated visualization tool for denoting hierarchical cluster coherence in brain time series. It provided a smooth interface for visually exploring the time-evolving topographic characteristics in a 3D environment based on the results of using the hierarchical cluster coherence method described in Euan et al. [HCC]. It was entirely written in the Javascript programming language using the functionalities of the WebGL standard.
